Inspiration

Took inspiration from the range of emotions all of us have felt through out this year of the pandemic
How we built it

Our talented artists used adobe illustrator to create the assets and professorial sound engineering equipment/software to create sound effects.

Our developers used C++ and SDL to create the game environment.
Challenges we ran into

Time constraints left programmers in crunch
Accomplishments that we're proud of

The sheer awe of beauty that Emmett's game world is like
What we learned

Estimate how long something is going to take then double it!
What's next for Emmett

Emmett will most likely have more levels added and eventually find its way into the game market
